/*Question:Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in x units of time, he finishes it in mâˆ—x units of time. But there is 
always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max d units of time. Given x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.
Input: First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers x,m,d.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.*/
